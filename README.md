# Spotify/Billboard/Youtube API Projects
This repository is a mix of projects that involve the mentioned API's. 

## Spotify_Billboard.py
This allows the user to obtain the artists from the Spotify and scrape the billboard API for the songs that the artist may have on the Billboard Top 100.

## Youtube_Spotify.py
This allows the user to get a youtube playlist and convert it into a spotify playlist. It also handles exceptions when there are issues with the youtube_dl API not having the artist's name or song name.
